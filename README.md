# What is Dungeon Master?
I was asked to make a discord bot that could have customized Dungeons and Dragons related features, I was originally going to add it another bot I was working on, but decided to just make a new bot specfically for the server instead. I open sourced the bot so that people can help me work on it, and also for the sake of transparency and open source software.

# Features
This bot has music playing capabilities, playing pre-determined music during Dungeons and Dragons campaigns. It uses YouTube to play music but I do not plan on commercializing the bot, and hope that whoever decides to run their own instance of the bot does not do the same, hence the GPL v3 license on it. It also has a work in progress character creation command for campaigns, and there are plans to include many more features!

# Contributing
You can contribute to this bot if you would like.

# Special Thanks
I would like to thank the [discord.js](https://discord.gg/djs) community for helping me with the development of this bot, and the dungeon master this bot was made for. I appreciate your help.

# DISCLAIMER 
Like with my game engine, I do not have much time to work on this bot, do not expect much commits.
